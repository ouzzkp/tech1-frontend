# Personnel Management System (Frontend)

## About The Project
This repository hosts the frontend code for a comprehensive Personnel Management System, designed to streamline the management of employee data and processes. Built using React, this interface provides a dynamic and user-friendly experience, enhanced by the efficiency of Node.js and the modern tooling provided by Vite.

The backend of this system, developed by a separate team, is implemented in Java, ensuring robust and scalable performance. This frontend is tailored to interact seamlessly with the backend, providing a cohesive and integrated system.

## Features
- **Employee Management**: Add, update, and remove employee records.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and tables for easy data interpretation.
- **Real-time Updates**: Synchronized with the backend to reflect changes instantly.
